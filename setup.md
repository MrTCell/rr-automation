## Requirements
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. **These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools**, but working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described below.

To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to **install everything prior to the start of the workshop**. If you encounter any install issues, please seek assistance before the workshop begins.

This lesson requires that you have recent installations of `R`, `RStudio` and certain packages installed on your machine:

- [Download `R`](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [Download `RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/)

Some of the exercises may not work if you are using older installations of the programs or packages.

Once you have downloaded and installed `R` and `RStudio`, launch `RStudio` and install a package.
